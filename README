NetClass README
===============

NetClass is a very simple (to use) socket and thread wrapper that
works under *NIX based systems as well as win32 based systems.  It
is written in C++ and is focused on simplicity and performance.

Note: If you are using NetClass on another platform, please send
information to netclass-general@lists.sourceforge.net

+ On some platforms, you need to run autogen.sh instead of the
  provided configure script.  Particularly if you see an error
  about your aclocal version.

+ For MS Visual C++ Project files, you must download the NetClass code
  from CVS.  The project files are not included with each release.
  Alternatively, to create a project, simply add all files to a new
  'library' project.

* On Apple/OS X, configure may fail with the following error:
--
ltconfig: you must specify a host type if you use `--no-verify'
Try `ltconfig --help' for more information.
configure: error: libtool configure failed
--
The temporary workaround is to edit the configure file and erase
the instance of '--no-verify'.  Then re-run configure.  If you
know how to fix this, please let me know...otherwise it'll get
fixed eventually (hopefully).
 

About NetClass
==============

NetClass includes easy to use general purpose sockets (ncSocket)
as ell as easy to use server sockets (ncSocketListener).

The thread support is basic enough to create a simple server in a
few lines of code.  Thread synchronization is currently provided
only in terms of mutual exclusion (ncMutex).

NetClass is a program library which once compiled and installed
can be linked against for your own projects.  Use is granted under
the terms of the GNU GPL.

This code has been originally designed and compiled using the
GNU/Linux 2.2.18+ kernel, as well as 2.4.x kernels.  It's also been
verified to work as expected on 2.5.x and 2.6.0test kernels.

NOTE: There are no doubt many libraries that export basic socket
and thread calls.  I wrote NetClass because it was a collection
of things that I found that I was commonly rewriting in every new
project I started.  Thus - while the code is ugly at places and this
library doesn't do a whole lot - it's still extremely useful to me
and my projects - and I offer it as Free Software to anyone else
that may find it useful as well.
